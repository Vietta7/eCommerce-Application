She set the direction and shaped it both visually and conceptually: from layout and logic to illustrations, text, and content cards. Ekaterina was the driving force behind the project, creating its concept, visual style, and overall vibe. She designed the user interface structure, developed visual elements, and crafted the cards, images, and descriptions. Thanks to her work, the product became friendly, consistent, and visually rich.',
